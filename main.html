	<h1>A Brief History of Blogs</h1>
<h2>Early Beginnings (1990s)</h2>
<p>The term "blog" was first coined in 1997 by Jorn Barger, a Swedish programmer. However, the concept of blogging dates back to the early 1990s, when individuals began sharing their thoughts and experiences online through personal websites and online diaries.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Blogging (2000s)</h2>
<p>In the early 2000s, blogging began to gain mainstream popularity, thanks in part to the launch of platforms like Blogger and WordPress. These platforms made it easy for anyone to create and maintain a blog, without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p>
<p><b>Key Features of Early Blogs:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Personal and often informal tone</li>
<li>Frequent updates, often daily or weekly</li>
<li>Links to other blogs and online resources</li>
</ul>
<h2>Modern Blogging (2010s-Present)</h2>
<p>Today, blogging has evolved to include a wide range of formats, styles, and topics. From personal blogs to business blogs, and from niche topics to broad interests, there's a blog out there for everyone.</p>
